/*
CODE CHALLENGE
Try to implement at least 3/4 of the following features during the remainder of class (hint: each takes roughly 15 or fewer lines of code to implement):
[ ] Add ball reset logic on successful shot
[ ] Improve shot logic by making pointer’s relative x-position shoot the ball in correct x-direction
[ ] Make one obstacle move left/right and bounce against screen edges
[ ] Create and display shot counter, score, and successful shot percentage
